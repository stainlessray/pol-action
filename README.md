## PolAction

This is an application being developed for the purpose of making local political officials 
more accessible to everyone who wishes to engage with political representatives in a meaningful way. After release there will be a sprint to implement the consumption of a second API for marrying "roll-call" vote histories with representatives by name.

### Where it stands

The application leverages Spring Boot and these dependencies:

<ol>
 Spring starter JPA <br>
 H2 in-memory database <br>
 Spring Web <br>
</ol>

There remains a need for testing through APi mocking. I am currently working on a new diagram for a cleaner implementation. More to come soon!
